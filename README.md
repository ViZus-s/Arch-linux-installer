# Arch-linux-installer

To be honest, I seriously want to make my own installer.
I originally intended to do it for myself, but why not extend it to others?

I think it will be finished by the end of this year or earlier.

I understand that it will likely be worse than other installers (and it will be).
But everyone starts small and this will be my general project, apart from discord, it's my way of learning and improving Linux.
